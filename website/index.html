            <p>I am a young student currently studying for my A-Levels (Computer Science(OCR), Maths, Further Maths and Physics). I intend to delve deeper into the world of programming
            , cybersecurity, and technology after school.
            </p>
            <p>I know a variety of programming languages such as python, c++, c and rust all at different confidence levels and have applied these in a variety of different programming
                projects.
            </p>
            <p>I also enjoy doing other extra curricular activities apart from programming, namely karate, badminton, and I enjoy playing video games in my free time with my friends.
