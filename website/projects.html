                <h4>Project 1: <a href = "https://github.com/RoccoGibbons/CalculatorUpdated" style= "color:black">calculator</a></h4>
                <p>For one of my first 'big' programming projects, I build a command line calculator in C++. I was learning this language as I needed it for my
                    work experience placement at <a href = "https://www.xors.com/" style="color: black">XOR systems</a> so I built this calculator as a way to learn
                    C++. I enjoyed programming in this language so after my week work experience I continued developing this calculator until I was happy with the result.
                    Looking back at the code now I can see how the code isn't particularly pleasing to look at and I could probably improve it but this was the first
                    big project I undertook and I am pleased with how it turned out. This calculator is able to take one input for the entire calculation and then 
                    calculate the answer with BIDMAS/ BODMAS/ PEMDAS (as long as there are no brackets, powers, etc.). I only got around to implementing the functionality
                    for the base operations (+, -, *, /).

                <h4>Project 2: Work Experience</h4>
                <p>Unfortunately I did not end up saving any of my work I completed for my work experience onto github. I completed a weeks worth of work experience with
                    <a href = "https://www.xors.com/" style="color: black">XOR systems</a> where I learnt about the world of embedded programming. I applied my new knowledge
                    C++ and worked with pre written libraries that the company made to interact with some machines prepared for me and some microcontrollers like a MBED board
                    and arduino. I was able to program a RGB led as well as make a sine wave with cusomisable amplitude and wavelength appear on a lcd screen. I also managed to
                    work with a single axis '3D printer arm' where I was able to experiment with speed, direction, acceleration, etc.

                <h4>Project 3: <a href = "https://github.com/RoccoGibbons/cs50x" style = "color: black">cs50</a></h4>
                <p>My next project was a collection of projects provided by the online harvard CS50 course. Due to having some experience in C++ with my previous
                    project, I felt comfortable learning a new language - C, which is very similar to C++ due to C++ being a superset of C. I worked my way through
                    the course learning the fundamentals of C, then applying it. This project was very useful as I got to see how different tools used in programming
                    (e.g. 
                    <a href = "https://github.com/RoccoGibbons/cs50x/tree/master/problemset5/hashTable" style="color: black">Hashmaps</a>
                    ) actually work beneath the hood. Whilst completing this project, C quickly became one of my favourite languages to program in due to
                    its barebones nature. After completing the C portion of CS50x, I moved onto the python section. I was already adept in python due to that being
                    the main language used when programming in school. After the python section, I moved onto new projects. The image shows the

                    voting in problem set 3.

                <h4>Project 4: <a href = "https://github.com/RoccoGibbons/SchoolProjects" style = "color: black">A-Level</a></h4>
                <p> Now there is a jump in time to after I completed my GCSE's. For my A-level computer science course we are learning key concepts in a project base format.
                    This is in order to practice programming for the main project that will be submitted for my A-levels. So far I have made a cli (command line interface) cipher
                    program that is able to encrypt and decrypt with options for 3 ciphers: caesar, substitution, stream. For the next project I made a website to learn web 
                    technologies - that is this website. I am sure to add to this in the future for when I complete more projects.

                <h4>Project 5: <a href = "https://github.com/RoccoGibbons/Ritangle" style = "color: black">Ritangle</a></h4>
                <p> I am participating in a nation-wide maths competition called 'Ritangle'. A series of questions are released every week for you and your team to
                    solve using any methods you wish (apart from A.I). This means that for some questions I am able to brute force the answer with a simple
                    python script. This is especially efficient for questions involving permuations and combinations as you are able to iterate through
                    every possible combination and set some conditions to only count the correct combinations/ ones that you actually want. So far I have solved 
                    2 questions using this method (Q1 and q5).
