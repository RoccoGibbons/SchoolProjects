                <h4>Project 1: <a href = "https://github.com/RoccoGibbons/CalculatorUpdated" style= "color:black">calculator</a></h4>
                <p>For one of my first 'big' programming projects, I build a command line calculator in C++. I was learning this language as I needed it for my
                    work experience placement at <a href = "https://www.xors.com/" style="color: black">XOR systems</a> so I built this calculator as a way to learn
                    C++. I enjoyed programming in this language so after my week work experience I continued developing this calculator until I was happy with the result.
                    Looking back at the code now I can see how the code isn't particularly pleasing to look at and I could probably improve it but this was the first
                    big project I undertook and I am pleased with how it turned out. This calculator is able to take one input for the entire calculation and then 
                    calculate the answer with BIDMAS/ BODMAS/ PEMDAS (as long as there are no brackets, powers, etc.). I only got around to implementing the functionality
                    for the base operations (+, -, *, /).

                <h4>Project 2: <a href = "https://github.com/RoccoGibbons/cs50x" style = "color: black">cs50</a></h4>
                <p>My next project was a collection of projects provided by the online harvard CS50 course. Due to having some experience in C++ with my previous
                    project, I felt comfortable learning a new language - C, which is very similar to C++ due to C++ being a superset of C. I worked my way through
                    the course learning the fundamentals of C, then applying it. This project was very useful as I got to see how different tools used in programming
                    (e.g. 
                    <a href = "https://github.com/RoccoGibbons/cs50x/tree/master/problemset5/hashTable" style="color: black">Hashmaps</a>
                    ) actually work beneath the hood. Whilst completing this project, C quickly became one of my favourite languages to program in due to
                    its barebones nature. After completing the C portion of CS50x, I moved onto the python section. I was already adept in python due to that being
                    the main language used when programming in school. After the python section, I moved onto new projects. The image shows the

                    voting in problem set 3.
